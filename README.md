r audio player is a portable, lightweight audio player made mainly for windows, built with c++ using qt 6.10.1, taglib, zlib, and miniaudio. a windows release build (and its source code) of the latest version is always available.

it is currently in early development, and as such many features are missing, incomplete, or bugged, and the source code may go through sudden refactors.

step-by-step build instructions will be provided for each release build starting v1.1, as it's planned to be the first content-complete build.
